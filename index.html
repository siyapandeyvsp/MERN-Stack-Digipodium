            <h2>Art</h2>
            <p>
            Art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those
            activities, usually involving imaginative or technical skill. In their
            most general form these activities include the production of works of
            art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the
            aesthetic dissemination of art.

            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>
            A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing
            or images, typically composed of many pages bound together and
            protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement
            is codex. In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended
            written compositions or records, the codex replaces its
            predecessor, the scroll.

            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>
            Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have
            biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes,
            from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or
            because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate.
